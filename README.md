## Scavenger Hunts
### Find the Code Word
This is a fun little hunt which requires some knowledge of computer science (but very basic) and some puzzles!

Each file is password protected. The solution to each clue will give you the code to open the next file.

Note: Word will ask you to open the files in the desktop app (because it's password protected).

Lets begin!

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/LakyG/LakyG.github.io/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
